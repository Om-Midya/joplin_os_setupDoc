## Errors Faced and Their Resolutions  
  
During the setup process, I encountered the following errors:  
  
1. **Error 1**: `electron package failed to build` 
	I faced this error when i ran `yarn install` for the first time

	**Resolution**:  
	- Read The `BUILD.md` DOC that stated to install necessary packages for LINUX environment
	- I ran the following command 
	- ```‚ùØ sudo apt install build-essential libnss3 libsecret-1-dev rsync libgbm-dev libatk-bridge2.0-0 libgtk-3-dev libasound2
	- Then I re-ran the command and this time it was executed successfully

2. **Error 2:** While trying to start React Native mobile application using `npm start`, I encountered an error related to watchman. The error message indicated that the user limit on the total number of `inotify` watches was reached.
	![[Pasted image 20240618180525.png]]
	**Resolution:**
	- To resolve this issue, I needed to increase the limit of `inotify` watches. This was done by running the following command in the terminal:
	```bash
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```
	- This command increases the limit to 524288, which should be sufficient for most projects.
	- After This I re-ran `npm start`and this time it was executed successfully.
